# Short bio

I am a PhD Student in the [IECL](https://iecl.univ-lorraine.fr/home/) lab at [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/) (Nancy, France) since January 2021. I am focusing on Statistics and Machine Learning, and especially time series analysis. My advisors are [Pr. Marianne Clausel](https://sites.google.com/site/marianneclausel/) and [Dr. Konstantin Usevich](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/konstantin.usevich). Before that, I obtained a BS degree in Mathematics from Sorbonne Université (Paris, France) and a MS degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics also from Sorbonne Université.

# Research interests

I am working on the use of the signature, a tool from rough paths theory, for time series analysis and statistical learning. This tool extract intrinsic information about a multidimensional time series and more precisely the dependencies in variations along the space dimensions. Find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03788) an introduction to this tool.
