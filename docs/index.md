# Short bio

I am currently a PhD Student at Université de Lorraine (Nancy, France) since January 2021. I am focusing on Statistics and Machine Learning, and especially time series analysis. My supervisors are Pr. Marianne Clausel and Dr. Konstantin Usevich. Before that, I obtained a BS degree in Mathematics from Sorbonne Université (Paris, France) and a MS degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics also from Sorbonne Université.
