# Short bio

I am a PhD Student in the [IECL](https://iecl.univ-lorraine.fr/home/) lab at [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/en/) (Nancy, France) since January 2021. I am focusing on Statistics and Machine Learning, and especially time series analysis. My advisors are [Pr. Marianne Clausel](https://sites.google.com/site/marianneclausel/) and [Pr. Konstantin Usevich](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/konstantin.usevich). Before that, I earned a BS degree in Mathematics and a MS degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science both from Sorbonne Université (Paris, France). Moreover, through internships, I have been practicing Data Science at leading companies and research institutes.

# Research interests

I am working on the use of the signature, a tool from rough paths theory, for time series analysis and statistical learning. This tool extract intrinsic information about multidimensional time series and more precisely the dependencies in variations along the space dimensions. Find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03788) an introduction to this tool.
